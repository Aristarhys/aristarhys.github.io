### We now have a Boosty (defunct) and Patreon (defunct) pages to do so.

You can subscribe to the only role of the Pholph so far (~2USD) to get access to the early access channel of "Sonata for an untuned cello" (defunct)

### FAQ on Boosty/Patreon

- Where will the money go? To pay for outsourced comic artist and the script-doctor (so it won't be amateur~ish like Everglow).

- Will there be a translation into English? Original comic production in in English, translation to other languages possible.

- Can I read comics without a subscription? Yes, chapter by chapter. For free.

- How long project will be in production? With current artist speed - more than 1 year. We will try to release chapter per quarter.

- What will the subscription give me? Access to a private chat where sketches, author's footnotes and the comic itself will be posted page by page as soon as they will get ready.

- Why do you need crowdfunding? To compensate just production costs of it. We not looking for profits in general. Just want to share a story.
