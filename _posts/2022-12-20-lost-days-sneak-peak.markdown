It's already a little bit left before the new year and Christmas and we want to share a sneak peak on the project. So what will The Lost Days be like?

### Gameplay features

* This will be a new standalone game (not DLC).
* Game will be much longer than Everglow.
* This is not a sequel or a prequel. The story will be about the time interval between Glow's arrival on the wolf planet and her departure on the Arbiter of Fate (10 years of lost days, huh)
* You will get answers to the questions and plot holes of the original game (as much as possible). This will also be clear to new players (who haven't played original Everglow)
* You will find yourself on the other side of the barricades and meet old friends.
* There will be ONE  true ending and many chances to screw up everything.  (Backbone sends his regards)
* You won't be playing as Glow. This is story of newly minted wolf  inspector Clarissa Squalus who is trying to solve a mysterious case #591286729879 (why the hell its so long?!)
* The game will be paid (but up to $15). We plan to look for a publisher because we will not pull such a project only with Aristarhys mentally and physically.

### Technical features

* **Platform**: PC, Steam. (there will be no mobile version)
* **Genre**: Visual novel, but we plan to add puzzles, mini-games and more interactive elements + a dash of RPG (Everglow was mostly a kinetic novel)
* **Engine**: Ren'py 8 (Everglow was made on 7)
* **Main language**: English (now with normal proof-read)
* **Additional translation**: Russian (in Everglow it was the opposite and it created a lot of problems)
* **Voice acting**: we will try to do the voice acting of the main characters (and not just the endings like Everglow, although it had its own specific effect)
* **Music: will change**, the original composer of Everglow is busy and cannot cooperate with us.
* **Setting**: less science fiction - more dystopia
* **Graphic style**: Will change, the original Everglow artist is busy and cannot collaborate with us. But we plan to switch to Live2D models and maintain a similar art-style.

### Roadmap

We don't have a clear roadmap  yet. But we plan to prepare a design document and a playable demo/MVP by the summer of 2023 in order to look for a publisher and investments. After that, the demo will be available to everyone!
