Everglow now is [playable](https://aristarhys.itch.io/everglow-web) in web browser thanks to renpy 8 web export support.

It can be used as mobile-friendly experience (tested on IOS and Android).

The extended support for this version are not planned and it's provided mostly as it is.

Desktop versions strongly suggested to be tried first.

The "real" mobile releases for IOS or Android are not planned.

The expansion to new platforms (i.e VKplay) is not planned.

The new translations are not planned.

The post release support cycle of VN is done.
